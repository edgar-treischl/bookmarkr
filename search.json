The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Master the Shiny web framework&;and take your R skills to a whole new level. Shiny helps you create fully interactive web apps for data analyses by letting you move beyond static reports, tables, and graphs. Your users will be able to jump between datasets, explore different subsets, run models with parameter values of their choosing, customize visualizations, and much more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHadley Wickham from RStudio shows data scientists, data analysts, statisticians, and scientific researchers with no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript how to create complex Shiny apps. Shiny is easy to learn, but even intermediate users often wonder what they've missed. This in-depth introduction provides a learning path that you can follow with confidence. #> 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Pro Git (Second Edition) is your fully-updated guide to Git and its usage in the modern world.
