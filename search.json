Data Visualization builds reader’s expertise ggplot2, versatile visualization library R programming language. series worked examples, accessible primer demonstrates create plots piece piece, beginning summaries single variables moving complex graphics. Topics include plotting continuous categorical variables; layering information graphics; producing effective “small multiple” plots; grouping, summarizing, transforming data plotting; creating maps; working output statistical models; refining plots make comprehensible. Effective graphics essential communicating ideas great way better understand data. book provides practical skills students practitioners need visualize quantitative data get research findings.  Effective visualization best way communicate information increasingly large complex datasets natural social sciences. increasing power visualization software today, scientists, engineers, business analysts often navigate bewildering array visualization choices options. practical book takes many commonly encountered visualization problems, provides guidelines turn large datasets clear compelling figures. visualization type best story want tell? make informative figures visually pleasing? Author Claus O. Wilke teaches elements critical successful data visualization.  Learn program diving R language, use newfound skills solve practical data science problems. book, ’ll learn load data, assemble disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write functions, use R’s programming tools. RStudio Master Instructor Garrett Grolemund teaches program, also shows get R just visualizing modeling data. ’ll gain valuable programming skills support work data scientist time.  Master Shiny web framework&;take R skills whole new level. Shiny helps create fully interactive web apps data analyses letting move beyond static reports, tables, graphs. users able jump datasets, explore different subsets, run models parameter values choosing, customize visualizations, much .  Pro Git (Second Edition) fully-updated guide Git usage modern world.
