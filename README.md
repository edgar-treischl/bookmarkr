Data Visualization: A practical introduction (by Kieran Healy)
</h2>
<a href='https://socviz.co/'target='_blank'><img align='right' src='https://socviz.co/assets/dv-cover-pupress.jpg' width='150' height='200'></a>
<p>

This book provides students and researchers a hands-on introduction to
the principles and practice of data visualization. It explains what
makes some graphs succeed while others fail, how to make high-quality
figures from data using powerful and reproducible methods, and how to
think about data visualization in an honest and effective way.

Data Visualization builds the reader’s expertise in ggplot2, a versatile
visualization library for the R programming language. Through a series
of worked examples, this accessible primer then demonstrates how to
create plots piece by piece, beginning with summaries of single
variables and moving on to more complex graphics. Topics include
plotting continuous and categorical variables; layering information on
graphics; producing effective “small multiple” plots; grouping,
summarizing, and transforming data for plotting; creating maps; working
with the output of statistical models; and refining plots to make them
more comprehensible.

Effective graphics are essential to communicating ideas and a great way
to better understand data. This book provides the practical skills
students and practitioners need to visualize quantitative data and get
the most out of their research findings.

Provides hands-on instruction using R and ggplot2 Shows how the
“tidyverse” of data analysis tools makes working with R easier and more
consistent Includes a library of data sets, code, and functions

<h2>
Regression and Other Stories (by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, Aki
Vehtari)
</h2>
<a href='https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/'target='_blank'><img align='right' src='https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/ROS_frontcover.png' width='150' height='200'></a>
<p>
Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of
examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle.
This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using
regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction,
and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues
such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and
techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use
immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors’ experience
demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical
advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for
experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to
logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on computation in R and
Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and
presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting.
