A Criminologist’s Guide to R: Crime by the Numbers introduces the
programming language R and covers the necessary skills to conduct
quantitative research in criminology. By the end of this book, a person
without any prior programming experience can take raw crime data, be
able to clean it, visualize the data, present it using R Markdown, and
change it to a format ready for analysis. A Criminologist’s Guide to
R focuses on skills specifically for criminology such as spatial joins,
mapping, and scraping data from PDFs, however any social scientist
looking for an introduction to R for data analysis will find this
useful.

<p>This book provides students and researchers a hands-on introduction
to the principles and practice of data visualization. It explains what
makes some graphs succeed while others fail, how to make high-quality
figures from data using powerful and reproducible methods, and how to
think about data visualization in an honest and effective way.</p>
<p>Data Visualization builds the reader’s expertise in ggplot2, a
versatile visualization library for the R programming language. Through
a series of worked examples, this accessible primer then demonstrates
how to create plots piece by piece, beginning with summaries of single
variables and moving on to more complex graphics. Topics include
plotting continuous and categorical variables; layering information on
graphics; producing effective “small multiple” plots; grouping,
summarizing, and transforming data for plotting; creating maps; working
with the output of statistical models; and refining plots to make them
more comprehensible.</p>
<p>Effective graphics are essential to communicating ideas and a great
way to better understand data. This book provides the practical skills
students and practitioners need to visualize quantitative data and get
the most out of their research findings.</p>
Provides hands-on instruction using R and ggplot2 Shows how the
“tidyverse” of data analysis tools makes working with R easier and more

Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of
examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle.
This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using
regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction,
and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues
such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and
techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use
immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors’ experience
demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical
advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for
experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to
logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on computation in R and
Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and
presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting.

<p>Spatial Data Science introduces fundamental aspects of spatial data
that every data scientist should know before they start working with
spatial data. These aspects include how geometries are represented,
coordinate reference systems (projections, datums), the fact that the
Earth is round and its consequences for analysis, and how attributes of
geometries can relate to geometries. In the second part of the book,
these concepts are illustrated with data science examples using the R
language. In the third part, statistical modelling approaches are
demonstrated using real world data examples. After reading this book,
the reader will be well equipped to avoid a number of major spatial data
analysis errors.</p>
The book gives a detailed explanation of the core spatial software
packages for R: sf for simple feature access, and stars for raster and
vector data cubes – array data with spatial and temporal dimensions. It
also shows how geometrical operations change when going from a flat
space to the surface of a sphere, which is what sf and stars use when
coordinates are not projected (degrees longitude/latitude). Separate
chapters detail a variety of plotting approaches for spatial maps using
R, and different ways of handling very large vector or raster (imagery)
datasets, locally, in databases, or in the cloud. The data used and all
code examples are freely available online from <a href="https://r-spatial.org/book/" class="external-link uri">https://r-spatial.org/book/</a>. The solutions to the
exercises can be found here: <a href="https://edzer.github.io/sdsr_exercises/" class="external-link uri">https://edzer.github.io/sdsr_exercises/</a>.

<p>Text data is important for many domains, from healthcare to marketing
to the digital humanities, but specialized approaches are necessary to
create features for machine learning from language. Supervised Machine
Learning for Text Analysis in R explains how to preprocess text data for
modeling, train models, and evaluate model performance using tools from
the tidyverse and tidymodels ecosystem. Models like these can be used to
make predictions for new observations, to understand what natural
language features or characteristics contribute to differences in the
output, and more. If you are already familiar with the basics of
predictive modeling, use the comprehensive, detailed examples in this
book to extend your skills to the domain of natural language
processing.</p>
This book provides practical guidance and directly applicable knowledge
for data scientists and analysts who want to integrate unstructured text
data into their modeling pipelines. Learn how to use text data for both
regression and classification tasks, and how to apply more
straightforward algorithms like regularized regression or support vector
machines as well as deep learning approaches. Natural language must be
dramatically transformed to be ready for computation, so we explore
typical text preprocessing and feature engineering steps like
tokenization and word embeddings from the ground up. These steps
influence model results in ways we can measure, both in terms of model
metrics and other tangible consequences such as how fair or appropriate
model results are.

<p>Much of the data available today is unstructured and text-heavy,
making it challenging for analysts to apply their usual data wrangling
and visualization tools. With this practical book, you’ll explore
text-mining techniques with tidytext, a package that authors Julia Silge
and David Robinson developed using the tidy principles behind R packages
like ggraph and dplyr. You’ll learn how tidytext and other tidy tools in
R can make text analysis easier and more effective.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate how treating text as data frames enables you
to manipulate, summarize, and visualize characteristics of text. You’ll
also learn how to integrate natural language processing (NLP) into
effective workflows. Practical code examples and data explorations will
help you generate real insights from literature, news, and social
media.</p>
Learn how to apply the tidy text format to NLP Use sentiment analysis to
mine the emotional content of text Identify a document’s most important
terms with frequency measurements Explore relationships and connections
between words with the ggraph and widyr packages Convert back and forth
between R’s tidy and non-tidy text formats Use topic modeling to
classify document collections into natural groups Examine case studies
that compare Twitter archives, dig into NASA metadata, and analyze
thousands of Usenet messages

<p>Get going with tidymodels, a collection of R packages for modeling
and machine learning. Whether you’re just starting out or have years of
experience with modeling, this practical introduction shows data
analysts, business analysts, and data scientists how the tidymodels
framework offers a consistent, flexible approach for your work.</p>
RStudio engineers Max Kuhn and Julia Silge demonstrate ways to create
models by focusing on an R dialect called the tidyverse. Software that
adopts tidyverse principles shares both a high-level design philosophy
and low-level grammar and data structures, so learning one piece of the
ecosystem makes it easier to learn the next. You’ll understand why the
tidymodels framework has been built to be used by a broad range of
people.

<p>blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown provides a practical
guide for creating websites using the blogdown package in R. In this
book, we show you how to use dynamic R Markdown documents to build
static websites featuring R code (or other programming languages) with
automatically rendered output such as graphics, tables, analysis
results, and HTML widgets. The blogdown package is also suitable for
technical writing with elements such as citations, footnotes, and LaTeX
math. This makes blogdown an ideal platform for any website designed to
communicate information about data science, data analysis, data
visualization, or R programming.</p>
Note that blogdown is not just for blogging or sites about R; it can
also be used to create general-purpose websites. By default, blogdown
uses Hugo, a popular open-source static website generator, which
provides a fast and flexible way to build your site content to be shared
online. Other website generators like Jekyll and Hexo are also
supported.

bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown
presents a much easier way to write books and technical publications
than traditional tools such as LaTeX and Word. The bookdown package
inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from
R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you
can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables,
equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you
can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your
document can even include live examples so readers can interact with
them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output
formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy
to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output
formats can be customized.
