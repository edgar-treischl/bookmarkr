A Criminologist’s Guide to R: Crime by the Numbers introduces the
programming language R and covers the necessary skills to conduct
quantitative research in criminology. By the end of this book, a person
without any prior programming experience can take raw crime data, be
able to clean it, visualize the data, present it using R Markdown, and
change it to a format ready for analysis. A Criminologist’s Guide to
R focuses on skills specifically for criminology such as spatial joins,
mapping, and scraping data from PDFs, however any social scientist
looking for an introduction to R for data analysis will find this
useful.

Successfully navigating the data-driven economy presupposes a certain
understanding of the technologies and methods to gain insights from Big
Data. This book aims to help data science practitioners to successfully
manage the transition to Big Data. Building on familiar content from
applied econometrics and business analytics, this book introduces the
reader to the basic concepts of Big Data Analytics. The focus of the
book is on how to productively apply econometric and machine learning
techniques with large, complex data sets, as well as on all the steps
involved before analysing the data (data storage, data import, data
preparation). The book combines conceptual and theoretical material with
the practical application of the concepts using R and SQL. The reader
will thus acquire the skills to analyse large data sets, both locally
and in the cloud. Various code examples and tutorials, focused on
empirical economic and business research, illustrate practical
techniques to handle and analyse Big Data.

<p>This book provides students and researchers a hands-on introduction
to the principles and practice of data visualization. It explains what
makes some graphs succeed while others fail, how to make high-quality
figures from data using powerful and reproducible methods, and how to
think about data visualization in an honest and effective way.</p>
<p>Data Visualization builds the reader’s expertise in ggplot2, a
versatile visualization library for the R programming language. Through
a series of worked examples, this accessible primer then demonstrates
how to create plots piece by piece, beginning with summaries of single
variables and moving on to more complex graphics. Topics include
plotting continuous and categorical variables; layering information on
graphics; producing effective “small multiple” plots; grouping,
summarizing, and transforming data for plotting; creating maps; working
with the output of statistical models; and refining plots to make them
more comprehensible.</p>
<p>Effective graphics are essential to communicating ideas and a great
way to better understand data. This book provides the practical skills
students and practitioners need to visualize quantitative data and get
the most out of their research findings.</p>
Provides hands-on instruction using R and ggplot2 Shows how the

<p>With an emphasis on social science applications, Event History
Analysis with R, Second Edition, presents an introduction to survival
and event history analysis using real-life examples. Since publication
of the first edition, focus in the field has gradually shifted towards
the analysis of large and complex datasets. This has led to new ways of
tabulating and analysing tabulated data with the same precision and
power as that of an analysis of the full data set. Tabulation also makes
it possible to share sensitive data with others without violating
integrity.</p>
<p>The new edition extends on the content of the first by both improving
on already given methods and introducing new methods. There are two new
chapters, Explanatory Variables and Regression, and Register- Based
Survival Data Models. The book has been restructured to improve the
flow, and there are significant updates to the computing in the
supporting R package.</p>
Features Introduction to survival and event history analysis and how to
solve problems with incomplete data using Cox regression. Parametric
proportional hazards models, including the Weibull, Exponential, Extreme
Value, and Gompertz distributions. Parametric accelerated failure time
models with the Lognormal, Loglogistic, Gompertz, Exponential, Extreme
Value, and Weibull distributions. Proportional hazards models for
occurrence/exposure data, useful with tabular and register based data,
often with a huge amount of observed events. Special treatments of
external communal covariates, selections from the Lexis diagram, and
creating period as well as cohort statistics. “Weird bootstrap” sampling
suitable for Cox regression with small to medium-sized data sets.
Supported by an R package (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eha" class="external-link uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eha</a>), including code

aspects of the modeling process. This book describes techniques for
finding the best representations of predictors for modeling and for
nding the best subset of predictors for improving model performance. A
variety of example data sets are used to illustrate the techniques along
with R programs for reproducing the results.

Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of
examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle.
This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using
regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction,
and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues
such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and
techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use
immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors’ experience
demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical
advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for
experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to
logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on computation in R and
Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and
presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting.

<p>Spatial Data Science introduces fundamental aspects of spatial data
that every data scientist should know before they start working with
spatial data. These aspects include how geometries are represented,
coordinate reference systems (projections, datums), the fact that the
Earth is round and its consequences for analysis, and how attributes of
geometries can relate to geometries. In the second part of the book,
these concepts are illustrated with data science examples using the R
language. In the third part, statistical modelling approaches are
demonstrated using real world data examples. After reading this book,
the reader will be well equipped to avoid a number of major spatial data
analysis errors.</p>
The book gives a detailed explanation of the core spatial software
packages for R: sf for simple feature access, and stars for raster and
vector data cubes – array data with spatial and temporal dimensions. It
also shows how geometrical operations change when going from a flat
space to the surface of a sphere, which is what sf and stars use when
coordinates are not projected (degrees longitude/latitude). Separate
chapters detail a variety of plotting approaches for spatial maps using
R, and different ways of handling very large vector or raster (imagery)
datasets, locally, in databases, or in the cloud. The data used and all
code examples are freely available online from <a href="https://r-spatial.org/book/" class="external-link uri">https://r-spatial.org/book/</a>. The solutions to the

<p>Text data is important for many domains, from healthcare to marketing
to the digital humanities, but specialized approaches are necessary to
create features for machine learning from language. Supervised Machine
Learning for Text Analysis in R explains how to preprocess text data for
modeling, train models, and evaluate model performance using tools from
the tidyverse and tidymodels ecosystem. Models like these can be used to
make predictions for new observations, to understand what natural
language features or characteristics contribute to differences in the
output, and more. If you are already familiar with the basics of
predictive modeling, use the comprehensive, detailed examples in this
book to extend your skills to the domain of natural language
processing.</p>
This book provides practical guidance and directly applicable knowledge
for data scientists and analysts who want to integrate unstructured text
data into their modeling pipelines. Learn how to use text data for both
regression and classification tasks, and how to apply more
straightforward algorithms like regularized regression or support vector
machines as well as deep learning approaches. Natural language must be
dramatically transformed to be ready for computation, so we explore
typical text preprocessing and feature engineering steps like
tokenization and word embeddings from the ground up. These steps
influence model results in ways we can measure, both in terms of model
metrics and other tangible consequences such as how fair or appropriate
model results are.

<p>The book equips students with the end-to-end skills needed to do data
science. That means gathering, cleaning, preparing, and sharing data,
then using statistical models to analyse data, writing about the results
of those models, drawing conclusions from them, and finally, using the
cloud to put a model into production, all done in a reproducible
way.</p>
At the moment, there are a lot of books that teach data science, but
most of them assume that you already have the data. This book fills that
gap by detailing how to go about gathering datasets, cleaning and
preparing them, before analysing them. There are also a lot of books
that teach statistical modelling, but few of them teach how to
communicate the results of the models and how they help us learn about
the world. Very few data science textbooks cover ethics, and most of
those that do, have a token ethics chapter. Finally, reproducibility is
not often emphasised in data science books. This book is based around a
straight-forward workflow conducted in an ethical and reproducible way:
gather data, prepare data, analyse data, and communicate those findings.
This book will achieve the goals by working through extensive case
studies in terms of gathering and preparing data, and integrating ethics
throughout. It is specifically designed around teaching how to write
about the data and models, so aspects such as writing are explicitly
covered. And finally, the use of GitHub and the open-source statistical
language R are built in throughout the book.

like ggraph and dplyr. You’ll learn how tidytext and other tidy tools in
R can make text analysis easier and more effective.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate how treating text as data frames enables you
to manipulate, summarize, and visualize characteristics of text. You’ll
